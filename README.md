# Safebet


he problem described involves a grid and a laser beam that is reflected by mirrors in the grid until it reaches the bottom row, where it exits the grid horizontally to the right. The objective is to determine whether the laser beam can open a safe, and if so, find the minimum number of mirror insertions required and their corresponding positions.

The grid is composed of rows and columns, and each cell in the grid can contain either a mirror or be empty. The mirrors have a 45-degree diagonal orientation, either in the form of "/" or "". When the laser beam encounters a mirror, it reflects off it according to the mirror's orientation.

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the possible paths of the laser beam through the grid. We can start by iterating through the cells in the top row, considering each cell as a potential starting point for the laser beam. For each starting cell, we simulate the path of the laser beam through the grid, following the reflection rules at each mirror encountered.

We keep track of the number of mirror insertions required and the lexicographically smallest position for each successful path that reaches the bottom row. If a path reaches the bottom row without requiring any mirror insertions, we output 0. If there are multiple successful paths with mirror insertions, we output the minimum number of insertions and the lexicographically smallest position.

However, there are cases where the safe cannot be opened, either with or without inserting a mirror. In such cases, we output "impossible."

The solution to this problem requires careful implementation of the path simulation and tracking of the necessary information for each test case. By considering all possible starting points for the laser beam, simulating its path through the grid, and analyzing the outcomes, we can determine whether and how the safe can be opened.

In conclusion, this problem involves analyzing the path of a laser beam through a grid of mirrors to determine if it can open a safe. By considering different starting positions, simulating the beam's path, and tracking the necessary information, we can identify the possible outcomes, including cases where the safe opens without inserting a mirror, cases where mirror insertions are required, and cases where opening the safe is impossible.
